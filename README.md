# The Basic Concept App

My custom app design for the online pet-centric store, [The Basic Concept](https://www.thebasicconcept.com). 

Disclaimer: This was done as a personal project and is no way affiliated with the original brand!! If you woud like to get some cool stuff for your pet you can find their website at [thebasicconcept.com](https://www.thebasicconcept.com)

## How this app was made

This app was built using the [flutter framework](https://flutter.dev/docs) and some additional external libraries from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).
These include:
- flutter_bloc: for state management
- http: for making HTTP requests

The backend consists of a JSON API created and host from (Postman),  a collaboration platform for API development. To create simple APIs like this, head over to their website at [postman.com](https://www.postman.com)
